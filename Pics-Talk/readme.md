README

In this project, we propose an innovative approach for automatically generating descriptive captions for images, leveraging recent advancements in both computer vision and natural language processing. This is done by recognizing the important objects, their attributes, the relationships among the various components present in the image and thereby generating corresponding descriptions.

ABOUT

This project is about  creating a model that can recognise the components in an image and generate corresponding image descriptions . In addition, the generated captions are converted into an audio file. This involves various tasks like including data collection, preprocessing, model architecture design, training, evaluation, integration, and deployment.
