Abstract

Text simplification is crucial for enhancing the accessibility of information to diverse audiences, including individuals with cognitive disabilities, language learners, and those with limited literacy skills. Our project Simplify explores the application of Natural Lan- guage Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically leveraging the T5 (Text-to-Text model Transformers) model, for text simplification tasks. We present an approach where the T5 model is trained on a specialized dataset curated for text simplification, termed as “AS- SET” (A Simplified and Standardized English Text corpus). ASSET comprises pairs of complex sentences and their simplified counterparts, providing rich training data for the T5 model to learn the mappings between complex linguistic structures and its simplified equivalents. Through fine-tuning T5 on the ASSET dataset, we plan to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in generating simplified versions of text while preserving the original semantics. T5 works with a general-purpose text-to-text format. This means it can be applied to various NLP tasks, including text simplification, by simply treating the simplification process as converting complex text to a simpler version thereby enabling it to capture intricate language patterns, resulting in more accurate and contextually appro- priate simplifications. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging state- of-the-art NLP models like T5 for automating the text simplification process, thereby improving

the accessibility and readability of textual content across various domains.
